## Assignment 2 Readme.md

What is a *Version Control System* and why are we using it in this course?

Put simply, a version control system allows you to make changes to files, see EVERY change
you've made, as well as see what comments you made about the change. The reason we are
using it in this course, is because it simplifies the process of "pushing" changes to the web service, in this case Github, and allow others to see what we have done in and on the assignment. It's also a system that is used in the field, so it makes sense to expose us to it early.

Work Cycle This week:

This week was simple enough, and mostly consisted of us/me creating a new readme file, as well as a new directory inside our already made repository on the website service, GitHub. There were no real "Choices" to make in this cycle, so none are written here.

Any problems or issues:

This Assignment was easy, and there were no major issues for me to deal with, and the same appears to be true on the part of my classmates, as there were no issues I heard of.

Anything you'd like to discuss further:

Not this week.

Any issues you posted to the repo? any issues you helped classmates with:

No, and no to the second part.
