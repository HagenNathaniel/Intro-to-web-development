<h2>Project 2 Readme.md</h2>

My experience with HTML this week was most a refresher...with a major exception. I had to learn to make pages load from a different folder. Which is something I hadn't done in the past. I was not fully able to get my links to some of my pages working, but the pages themselves work! In the past, I was taught to put all pages in the same folder, probably for ease of coding.

CSS......the bane of my existence, next to bills and taxes...lol. I did this in a previous web design course, and I ended up abandoning it to STRICTLY do old school HTML. I couldn't seem to get the hang of setting it up, or to get it working right, besides when we did it as a class. Funny how things work when you do it with the instructor, but even though I followed the same basic steps, my version crashed and burned. would like to understand why.

my work cycle this week was first deciding on what I wanted to do, and then deciding HOW to go about it. I originally was going to do a 'step by step with pictures' scenario...but the time it takes to do that activity, coupled with my schedule for other courses and my day job...made that impossible, and MAY have resulted in complications to a several-thousand dollar piece of equipment I had build myself, if I rushed it..So I decided that was too risky, and went with option 2. a step by step (general) guide with a link to a more thorough guide on another page.

I had little trouble, other than  I couldn't get my links working right completely. ran out of time to find out why.

I saw no issues from other students, so I didn't help anyone.

Would love to understand page navigation links better, that's all I can think of right now.
