<p><h1>About the Author</p></h1>

<p><center><h4> For close to 19 years, I have been an avid computer user, specializing in PC hardware technology. As a set of side hobbies, I am a Twitch streamer, content creator, coder, gamer, PC builder and a MASSIVE nerd. I enjoy all things nerdy, geeky, and electronic, and also LOVE fantasy art! </p></center></h4>
<p></p>
<p><center><h4> In 2014, I began my college pursuits at the University of Montana, Bitterroot College program. In early 2017, I graduated with an AAS in Information technology, with an AS in Computer Support.</p></center><h4>
<p></p>
<p><center><h4> In late 2017, I began my second major degree in the University of Montana, first starting at the Missoula College campus, than moving to the mountain campus in fall of 2018. I am currently 33 years old. The degree I am working on, is a Bachelor's in Fine Arts, Media Arts, with a focus on Digital art and technology.</p></center></h4>
<p><center><h4> I chose this project for my instructable, because I am a certified CompTIA A+ PC tech, and I feel everyone who is interested in computers, and/or gaming, should experience the thrill of building a PC with their own two hands! It is a lot of fun, and you learn how computers and their components work together, in order to function.</p></center></h4>
<p><center><h4> As stated in the build guide, the guide was NOT a <em> COMPLETE </em> step by step guide, my original plan included taking my workstation apart, and doing it step by step that way, but time made that impossible. (it's the first picture on that page..Yes, that is my  own <em><b>ACTUAL</em></b> PC). To that end, I highly recommend you take a look at JayztwoCents on Youtube. He's a technology/PC guru, and has MANY great videos, including the one I will be linking below.</p></center></h4>
