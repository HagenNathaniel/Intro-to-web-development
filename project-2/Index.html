  <p> As a Gamer, I play on a variety of plaforms, including PC. In fact, I have <b>BUILT</b> several of my own systems.</p>
  <p> To that end, this guide will walk you through the steps you need to build your own PC!</p>
  <p> This guide will <em>NOT </em> be very detailed, but will end with a link to a video that <em>IS</em> detailed,

  <p> <b> Items needed:</p></b>
  <p><b> IMPORTANT NOTE: Your chosen components MUST be compatible with each other,
  i.e. Motherboard and CPU. Intel boards will <em> NOT </em> work with AMD Processors, and vice versa!!</p></b>

<p><h3> Instructions for Assembly </p></h3>
<ol>
  <li> Find a place you can spread out, and have room to work! </li>
  <p></p>
  <li> Take all the components you need to build the system out, and CAREFULLY unwrap them from their packaging. (Computer components are Electro-static discharge sensitive, As a PC Tech, I recommend an anti-static wrist strap!)</li>
  <p></p>
  <li> I always start with the motherboard standoffs, which are small, bolt-shaped screws with open, threaded ends. Install them into the case, in the holes that correspond to the motherboard form factor you chose.</li>
  <p></p>
  <li> After that, install the I/O shield contained in your motherboard packaging, it looks like a sheet of tin with holes in it.</li>
  <li> Once the I/O shield and standoffs are in, carefully place the motherboard into the case. Then screw it into the standoffs.</li>
  <li> Next, let's install the CPU! for AMD, Open the lever on the side of the socket, line up the yellow 'triangle' on the corner of the processor, with the triangle 'indent' on the socket. Then slide the lever back down. It holds the CPU in.</li>
  <p> For intel, similar story, but there will be a small black 'cover' on the lever assembly, leave that in, and install the Processor like you did the AMD, the cover will pop out when you engage the ZIF (Zero insertion force) socket cpu holder. Simply slide the notched hole on the bottom of the socket bracket under the head of the screw, and push the lever down to engage the socket clamp.</p>
  <p> <em> DON'T FORGET YOUR THERMAL SOLUTION, </em> or your processor will overheat! </p>
  <li> Now let's install the Memory. In <em> MOST </em> motherboard configurations, you want the Memory sticks (Referred to as "DIMM's"), in the first Memory slot on the right, and the 3rd one from the right. Don't worry about installing them incorrectly, they only fit in one way :) (it's always best to install Memory in pairs, for best performance). </li>
  <p></p>
  <li> Next up, Graphics card. Not much chance of doing this wrong, just remove the corresponding slot covers on the back of the case, where the card will be installed. Then install the card, video outputs towards the back, in the PCI-Express x16 slot. (Install in the topmost slot, most motherboards have this set up as a full bandwidth slot).
  <li> Following this up with long term storage, also called hard drives. (and optical drives, should you have decided to get one). <em> EVERY </em> computer case has a special place for these, with mounting hardware included, if necessary. Install the drives based on the instructions that came with your case. </li>
  <p></p>
  <li> Finally, we install the power supply. No worries, this isn't the same as wiring a home. <em> most </em> reputable power supply companies label their power supply cables based on where they go. and plugs typically don't allow you to install them in the wrong socket, so no need to apply THAT much force, except for the 24-pin motherboard socket. </li>
  <p> Congratulations, you built a pc! All you need to do, is install an operating system, and you'll be on your way! :) </p>
