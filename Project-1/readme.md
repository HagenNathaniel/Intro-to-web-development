# Project 1 Readme.md

I have been using Mozilla since I wanna say 2006, sometimes I use safari, but not often. A browsers' primary funcion is to render html, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages. A browser is mainly able to do this via the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

I decided to take a look at Google.com, and the date I chose was February 26, 2009. And, I can honestly say, Google hasn't really changed. The 'Google' logo was multi colored, and besides that there wasn't much else different. Now it's got a logo that changes based on seasons, events, etc.

Summarizing my work assignment this cycle, I was able to get the project coded, but my attempts to get the live page to display anything but a 'error 404,' despite trying everything I could, and even with help, was met with frustrating failure.

The issues I had I have already described, an error 404 I could NOT get to work at all, despite every attempt I, as well as another student, tried.

This week, there really isn't much I want to learn, to be honest.

I DID post an issue to a forum, but it was in my creative coding course issues forum, but it's a similar course setup to web development 1. I did not see any students that needed help, so I did not help anyone this cycle.
