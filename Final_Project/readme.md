What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?  Borders are ACTUAL borders put around an element, usually in the form of lines, that surround the element on all sides. Margin is the spacing between the edges of an element, and the surrounding area, ie, the edges of a webpage. Padding is INSIDE a border, used in an element.

What was the hardest thing for you this assignment? For me, it was the background. I couldn't get it to take up the whole screen. 

MY work cycle this week was:

This week was all about element placement. and how to set up a page using 'box models.' Something I STRUGGLE to do..

My initial idea, same as it was with my Creative coding I course, was to use a "gaming" theme in my design. Since that is my favorite pasttime, next to content creation and video editing. I went on from there.

Issues I encountered were mostly css related, getting them to work was fun. but I EVENTUALLY triumphed enough to be happy with the result...mostly.

Any STUDENT issues you helped on? No.

Anything you would like to learn more about: Background placement, automatic website sizing based on device viewed on, etc.
