The difference between span and Div is that span is in line, and used for
a small chunk of html code, whereas a div, is block line, similar to having
a line break before and after it, and generally is used for larger chunks of code.

originally designed to describe images to someone not able to view it. it still
serves a similar purpose, but really helps when the link it is attached to,
is moved or broken for some reason.

This week's work was all about media organization on a website/page. it
entailed 'grouping' objects in an organized, and easy to read manner.

I did not encounter any issues in this week's cycle, in fact, it went VERY well.
only issue I had, turned out to be a problem where I misspelled the target images'
name, and didn't specify attributes for the image, ie size. I also was unable to find
any non-video links to the audio track, I DO have the file for the song on my PC,
but the assignment parameters didn't allow for its use, and it would be a
copyright violation regardless.

I did not see any issues from any student's that required my assistance, as usual,
before I could say anything, (was usually at work or driving when I got the
notification), another student answered, or the student with the issue was able
to resolve it themselves.

Would I like to explore anything further? Not this week, perhaps another time,
this week was simple enough to understand.
