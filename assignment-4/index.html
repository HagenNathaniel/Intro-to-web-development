    <p><h1> Lyrics</h1></p>
    <p> Verse</p>
    <p>I've practiced this for hours, gone round and round</p>
<p>And now I think that I've got it all down</p>
<p> And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds </p>
<p> 'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out</p>
<p> Not wrappin' this in ribbons </p>
<p> Shouldn't have to give a reason why </p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p> It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow </p>
<p> I can't believe that I stayed till today</p>
<p> Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow </p>
<p> But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise </p>
<p> Verse</p>
<p>    It came out like a river once I let it out</p>
<p>    When I thought that I wouldn't know how</p>
<p>    Held onto it forever, just pushing it down</p>
<p>    Felt so good to let go of it now</p>
<p>    Not wrapping this in ribbons</p>
<p>    Shouldn't have to give a reason why</p>
<p>    Chorus</p>
<p>    It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow</p>
<p>    I can't believe that I stayed till today</p>
<p>    There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow</p>
<p>    There's nothing here in this soul left to say</p>
<p>    Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow</p>
<p>    God knows we tried to find an easier way</p>
<p>    Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow</p>
<p>    But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise</p>
<p>    Extended Chorus</p>
<p>    Our favorite place we used to go</p>
<p>    The warm embrace that no one knows</p>
<p>    The loving look that's left your eyes</p>
<p>    That's why this comes as no, as no surprise </p>
<p>    Ending Verse/Chorus</p>
<p>    If I could see the future and how this plays out </p>
<p>    I bet it's better than where we are now</p>
<p>    But after going through this It's easier to see the reason why </p>
<p></p>
<p>    It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow </p>
<p>    I can't believe that I stayed till today (stayed till today)</p>
<p>    Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow   </p>
<p>    But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise</p>
<p>    The kiss goodnight, it comes with me</p>
<p>    Both wright and wrong, our memories</p>
<p>    The whispering before we sleep, Just one more thing that you can't keep</p>
<p>    Our favorite place we used to go </p>
<p>    The warm embrace that no one knows</p>
<p>    The loving look that's left your eyes</p>
<p>    But I know in time we'll find this was no surpriseï»¿.</p>
