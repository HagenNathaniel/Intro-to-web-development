## Assignment 6 Readme.md

A:) This week, I decided to, since I LOVE Jules Verne, Choose "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."
I further decided to get some fonts that I felt came from the time period, Script (in this case, Dancing Script).
Due to the fact I liked it, I also chose 'Arvo' as a secondary, and Sans-serif as a backup.

B:) The difference between system fonts and web fonts, is simple..System fonts are locally stored and installed in your system.
Web fonts are specifically designed for web use, and are loaded in CSS docs. Web safe fonts are, just with CSS, rendered correctly.
The importance of a 'fallback font' is just in case the Browser is unable to render the font as instructed, it's a way

C:)

1. This week's work cycle was pretty simple and straightforward. IT was my second attempt at CSS, which is something I loathe..
I picked my excerpt, and then my fonts, going with the time period of the piece's origin. Wanted to be as authentic as possible :)

2. I had little trouble getting things going, my css may not function, but I did it using the ones in the course page as a guide. So THAT
much should be right! links are all there, files, etc.

3. I did not notice any students with issues, so I could not help them. I did not post any isssues I had either, figured them mostly out myself.

4. I would love to learn more about CSS, so that I can REALLY get crazy with it in the future..
