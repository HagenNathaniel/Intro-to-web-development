# Assignment 5 Readme.md


My design research for this assignment, was to take a page from my childhood. As a boy who grew up in the 90's, and early 00's, I have fond memories of that decade. As such, I used a Sony Entertainment logo, as well as the "I love the 90's" picture from the clipart for the assignment, to help 'push' the point home that "this is what the 90's were for me."


I chose brown, blue, and red. I associate my time in that decade with: Pepsi, Crash, and dirt.

This week's work cycle was my first foray into CSS, where I had to go from scratch. While my css sheet doesn't seem to be working, I do understand the thought process behind it, even if I am more of a 'single page of code' kind of guy.

Besides my css not working, I didn't encounter any issues in this cycle, most of it went smoothly.

My work week consisted of: Doing research for my second image, reliving old memories of that decade, and then coding the webpage.

I am not aware of any student issues for this week, so I was not able to help or assist anyone in troubleshooting their work.
