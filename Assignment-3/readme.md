1. A page can have as many headings as you want, BUT shouldn't have more than 1 h1 heading. Each heading should be in a 'reducing' importance order, starting from h1, and going to h6, if needed.

2. Put simply, structural markup creates order in a page, and is more important than semantic. Semantic markup has more to do with presentation, than it does about the layout of the page's structure. Another way to look at it, is Semantics = 'eye candy,' and structural = 'framework.'

</br>
For myself, this week was relatively easy, I was able to finish the webpages in about 2 hours, and upload soon after. I had no really pressing problems with it's design and layout.
<br>
</br>
I had no issues I couldn't figure out on my own, so there's nothing to put here.
<br>
</br>
I didn't see any issues from my fellow classmates I COULD personally help them fix. Seems most of us are getting the hang of this.
<br>
</br>
There was no topics I would like to spend more time with, besides maybe coloring backgrounds and such, but I figure that's coming up soon in the course, so, nothing to put here either.
